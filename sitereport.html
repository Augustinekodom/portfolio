        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>To be totally honest, I had a bit of HTML and CSS experience before I started this project however, this was self-taught from around 4/5 years ago so most of it was outdated or wrong (taught through YouTube videos and also Coding forums). 
            This didn’t make the project any easier if I’m being totally honest. 
        </p>
        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p>To start off I made my index.html page fist along with the main.css. In the index page, I decided to start off with the skeleton of the navigation bar first. I’m not going to lie, getting it to look the way it does on desktop was the easy part but then when it came to making it responsive and changing it to the hamburger menu when the dimensions of the screen got smaller was more challenging than I anticipated. I had to go back to that lesson where I was taught how to make the hamburger menu with HTML and CSS only (I watched it about 5 times). Personally, I think that if I was allowed to use JavaScript this part would have been much much easier but I didn’t know if I was allowed to use JavaScript so I just stuck to HTML and CSS. In the end I was able to make it work using a combination of checkboxes and other CSS properties. </p>
        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <p>After getting the navigation bar to work I decides to create all the pages and add the navigation bar to each of them (Felt like most of the work had been done after I did this (I was wrong Lol).  I then went back to the home page and completed it. Oh yh, I forgot to mention where I got my inspiration for the colour scheme from. I got it from the official website of the university of Northampton (Black, white and Yellow). 
            For the layout of my homepage I decided to use grid layout this was confusing at first to understand but after re-watching the lectures and a couple YouTube videos, I got the idea and implemented it. 
        </p>
        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <p>On week three I decide to complete the contact page. Again, I forgot most of the relevant tags for making a html form so I had to go back to the lecture and re-watch the videos to remind myself a bit. I set out the structure of the form and then after I applied a bit of style to it. One problem that I had after doing this is that when I press the hamburger button for the navigation the form comes in front of it. Even after adding a z-index of 999 to the navigation. I still haven’t found a way to fix this bug. The submit button doesn’t do anything at this point in time but I’m hoping in future I can amend my code once I’ve learnt some server-side scripting.</p>
        <h2>Week 4</h2>
        <p>I went on to start the CV page. With this, I was a bit clueless so I decided to design how it’s going to look in adobe illustrator first before I started writing the code for it. (this actually made it somewhat easier to code as the vision was clear. One problem that I’m having with the cv page is that I’ve added an image and styled it to make it look circular however, when the page stretches or contracts, the image doesn’t remain circular, it reverts to an oval shape. I need to find a solution to this. Apart from this little bug everything is fine. With the cv page. 

            Okay so the problem I had with the image stretching when the resolution of the screen changed has been solved. Turns out all I had to do was wrap the “img” tag in a “div” tag.
        </p>

        <h2>A ‘reflective discussion of your module experience’. </h2>
        <p>To be completely honest, this one of the modules that I look forward to every week because it’s easy to understand and also implement. Moving forward next term, I’d like t spend some quality time experimenting with the knowledge I gain form each lecture. I think this will help me embed the knowledge even more that it already is.
            Looking forward to learning JavaScript and PHP.
